# Illustrator-training

This is a mockup project I did while learning Illustrator. The idea I had in mind was to represent simple elements, such as animals, geometric figures to learn how to use all the tools in the best way. I started with simple drawings to get the hang of Illustrator, then I used the curvature tool, pencil, pen, various brushes and other tools for all subsequent drawings. I tried to color some of these drawings respecting the concept of shadows and colors.
